This directory contains the code and results for generating the plot showing the effect of dependent rows in the data.

`python dependence.py measure <job_num>` generates a measure for one column in one dataset (from `../original_data_parquet`) for one amount of replication for one model (overfitting or not). It places the results of that measure in a `json` file in directory `dependence_results`. This code is meant to be run within a SLURM or other cluster computing environment. If SLURM, all jobs can be run an SBATCH script similar to this:

```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=dependences
#SBATCH --output=/your-path/slurm_dependence_out/out.%a.out
#SBATCH --time=7-0
#SBATCH --mem=10G
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1
#SBATCH --array=0-45
arrayNum="${SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID}"
source /your_path/venv/bin/activate
python /your_path/dependence.py measure $arrayNum
```

`python dependence.py gather` reads in all of the `json` files generated by the `measure` jobs, and creates the file `dependence_results/dependence_results.parquet`. For your convenience, this repo contains the `dependence_results/dependence_results.parquet` file generated from running all of the `measure` commands.

`python dependence.py plot` reads in `dependence_results/dependence_results.parquet` and generates a variety of plots (png and pdf). `ind_default_overfit2.pdf` is used for the paper.
